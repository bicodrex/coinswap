Optimize UTXO handling with in-memory caching  

- Added `utxo_cache` in `WalletStore` to store UTXOs from `listunspent` RPC calls, reducing redundant network requests.  
- Implemented `update_utxo_cache` to update and maintain the cache efficiently using `RwLock`.  
- Overrode `PartialEq` for `WalletStore` since `RwLock` does not implement it, ensuring correct equality checks.  
- Updated `get_all_utxo` to leverage caching, reducing unnecessary RPC calls while keeping UTXO data fresh.  

This improves wallet performance and reduces RPC overhead. ðŸš€
